# == Define: jboss::interface
#
# This defined type can be used to setup JBoss interfaces. It can add, remove or change
# existing interfaces.
#
# More info about interfaces may be found here: https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY9/Interfaces+and+ports
#
# === Parameters
#
# This type uses *JBoss module standard metaparameters*
#
# [*interface_name*]
#     **This is the namevar**. Name of the interface to manage.
# [*ensure*]
#     Standard ensure parameter. Can be either `present` or `absent`.
#
# === Exclusive parameters
#
# Parameters listed here are exclusive. Only one of them can be set at once.
#
# [*any_address*]
#     This is boolean parameter. If set to `true` JBoss will bind network to any network ip.
#     Bassicly its the same as passing `0.0.0.0` as inet address.
# [*any_ipv4_address*]
#     This is boolean parameter. If set to `true` JBoss will bind network to any ipv4 network ip.
#     It is similar as passing `0.0.0.0` as inet address.
#     This parameter is deprecated for JBoss EAP 7.x and WildFly 9.x and later.
# [*any_ipv6_address*]
#     This is boolean parameter. If set to `true` JBoss will bind network to any ipv6 network ip.
#     It's should be the same as passing `::`.
#     This parameter is deprecated for JBoss EAP 7.x and WildFly 9.x and later.
# [*inet_address*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether or not the address matches the given value. Value is either a IP
#     address in IPv6 or IPv4 dotted decimal notation, or a hostname that can be resolved to an IP
#     address. An `undef` value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.
#     For ex.: `172.20.0.1`
# [*link_local_addres*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether or not the address is link-local. An `undef` or `false` value
#     means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.
# [*loopback*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether or not it is a loopback address. An `undef` or `false` value
#     means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.
# [*loopback_address*]
#     Attribute indicating that the IP address for this interface should be the given value, if a
#     loopback interface exists on the machine. A 'loopback address' may not actually be configured
#     on the machine's loopback interface. Differs from inet-address in that the given value will
#     be used even if no NIC can be found that has the IP specified address associated with it.
#     An `undef` or `false` value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address
#     selection. For ex. `127.0.1.1`
# [*multicast*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether or not its network interface supports multicast. An `undef`
#     or `false` value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.
# [*nic*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether its network interface has the given name. The name of a network
#     interface (e.g. eth0, eth1, lo). An `undef` value means this attribute is not relevant to
#     the IP address selection. For ex.: `eth3`
# [*nic_match*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether its network interface has a name that matches the given regular
#     expression. Value is a regular expression against which the names of the network interfaces
#     available on the machine can be matched to find an acceptable interface. An `undef` value
#     means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection. For ex.: `^eth?$`
# [*point_to_point*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether or not its network interface is a point-to-point interface. An
#     `undef` or `false` value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection
# [*public_address*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether or not it is a publicly routable address. An `undef` or `false`
#     value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection
# [*site_local_addres*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether or it is a site-local address. An `undef` or `false` value
#     means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection
# [*subnet_match*]
#     Attribite indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be evaluated from regular expression against a subnets of all interfaces. An
#     example: `192.168.0.0/24`
# [*up*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether its network interface is currently up. An `undef` or `false`
#     value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection
# [*virtual*]
#     Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this
#     interface should be whether its network interface is a virtual interface. An `undef` or
#     `false` value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection

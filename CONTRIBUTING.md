This module has grown over time based on a range of contributions from
people using it. If you follow these contributing guidelines your patch
will likely make it into a release a little quicker.


## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`)

3. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and
   it's great to know that you have a clean slate

4. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation
   changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality
   or fixing a bug, please add a test.

5. Make the test pass.

6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.


## Dependencies

The testing and development tools have a bunch of dependencies,
all managed by [bundler](http://bundler.io/) according to the
[Puppet support matrix](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html#ruby-versions).

By default the tests use a baseline version of Puppet.

If you have Ruby 2.x or want a specific version of Puppet,
you must set an environment variable such as:

    export PUPPET_VERSION="~> 3.2.0"

Install the dependencies like so... (you can also pass `--path /fs/path/for/deps` to fetch dependencies to other directory)

    bundle install

## Syntax and style

The test suite will run [Puppet Lint](http://puppet-lint.com/) and
[Puppet Syntax](https://github.com/gds-operations/puppet-syntax) to
check various syntax and style things. You can run these locally with:

    bundle exec rake lint
    bundle exec rake syntax

## Running the unit tests

The unit test suite covers most of the code, as mentioned above please
add tests if you're adding new functionality. If you've not used
[rspec-puppet](http://rspec-puppet.com/) before then feel free to ask
about how best to test your new feature. Running the test suite is done
with:

    bundle exec rake spec

Note also you can run the syntax, style and unit tests in one go with:

    bundle exec rake test

## Automatically run the Integration tests

During development of your puppet module you might want to run your unit tests a couple of times. You can use the following command to automate running the unit tests on every change made in the manifests folder.

  bundle exec guard

## Integration tests

The unit tests just check the code runs, not that it does exactly what
we want on a real machine. For that we're using
[beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker).

This fires up a new virtual machine (using vagrant) and runs a series of
simple tests against it after applying the module. You can run this
with:

    bundle exec rake acceptance

This will run the tests on an Centos 6.5 docker container. You can also
run the integration tests against any other configuration specified in directory `spec/acceptance/nodesets`. For example for Ubuntu 14.04 running on virtualbox via Vagrant you should run:

    RS_SET=ubuntu-14.04-x86_64-vagrant bundle exec rake acceptance

**Caution!** To run Vagrant boxes when you have installed Vagrant in version 1.5 or above, you need to have `bundler` in version range: >= 1.5.2 <= 1.10.5. This is due to fact of invalid version in vagrant-wrapper gem package.

If you don't want to have to recreate the virtual machine every time you
can use `BEAKER_DESTROY=no` and `BEAKER_PROVISION=no`. On the first run you will
at least need `BEAKER_PROVISION` set to yes (the default). The Vagrantfile
for the created virtual machines will be in `.vagrant/beaker_vagrant_files`.
